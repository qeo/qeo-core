# Tinq Open Source Project #

Welcome to the Tinq Open Source Project.
Tinq is completely based on the Qeo publish/subcribe framework produced by Technicolor as explained in the license section.

## About Tinq ##

Tinq is a software framework that allows devices to easily exchange data with other devices on the same network based on a publish-subscribe paradigm.

- Break the silos. Tinq defines a set of standard datamodels that allows your application to interact with a wide range of devices, regardless of their manufacturer.
- Secure. All communication between different devices is encrypted.
- Access control. The end-user has full control over what data can be accessed by which other user/device/application.
- Beyond the local network. Devices that are not in the local network can still exchange data with that network by connecting to a forwarder.

## Supported Platforms ##
Before building the source, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- A 32-bit or 64-bit Linux system.
- 300MB of free disk space.

## Building ##

You can build the open source version using the `build.sh` script. This script takes one argument to specify the directory to which the resulting artifacts will be copied.

    $ ./build.sh install
